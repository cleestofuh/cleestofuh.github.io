        <h3 class="casestudy-header">My Role</h3><br>
        <p>The Click n Dig Item Finder is a radio activated receiver for items like keys, remotes, and wallets, as a gift for forgetful friends and family. The Click n Dig website was due for a redesign before the holidays.</p>
        <p>In the timespan of 8 weeks, my multidisciplinary team of 4 worked with the client to figure out how to attract new customers and increase sales. My responsibilities ranged from doing research to UI design and the primary front-end development.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="my-role">
        <h3 class="casestudy-header">The Challenge</h3><br>
        <p>The first step to defining the challenges was to speak to our client, the CEO of the product company. We asked a number of questions to gain some insight on what his needs were. Afterwards, we defined our priority list of what we wanted to achieve.</p><br>

        <p>Who are your target customers/users?</p>
        <p class="supporting-text">"Our target customers are people who are buying gifts for their family members, especially for those older generations who are not super comfortable with new technology. When the holidays are coming, they could be gifts too."</p><br>

        <p>What sets your product apart from others?</p>
        <p class="supporting-text">"This product can be used for people who are not comfortable with a smartphone because it uses radio frequency instead of bluetooth. You do not need a smartphone to track the receiver, which is our niche in the current market, because everything is moving towards the usage of smartphones which isolates the individuals who aren’t as tech-savvy."</p><br>

        <p>What kind of feeling/branding would you like on your website?</p>
        <p class="supporting-text">"We want the website to explain how it works. Even though we have some instructions, they are not clear enough. Sometimes people are still confused. It would be nice to explain how big it is too. We want to give people the feeling that “yes it does what you think it does, it is the answer to your problem”. Currently our website is not clear enough. In terms of branding, there is no consistent brand, so the idea is open to however we would like to do it."</p><br>

      <section class="user-interviews">
        <h3 class="casestudy-header">User Interviews</h3><br>
        <p>After speaking to the client, we went on to interview potential users that fit the target market. We asked the users to take a look through the website and followed with questions afterward. </p><br>

        <p>Here are some of the questions we asked:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Based on the brief website overview, what would you want to find out/know about it?</li>
          <li>What are your initial thoughts on the website?</li>
          <li>Do you know what the product does and is used for?</li>
          <li>Describe a time you lost something. Do you think Click n Dig could have helped in the situation?</li>
          <li>How do you like to online shop?</li>
        </ul><br>

        <p>Here are some of the answers we received:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>"One thing that wasn’t very clear by initially looking through the website was how big the product actually was. A comparison to another object or showing it on an actual item that could be lost would be a big help."</li>
          <li>"The website looks like one of those “As Seen On TV” type of products which is a bit unprofessional--especially the woman scratching her head. The website itself made me lose interest in the product."</li>
          <li>"It looks like it uses some sort of frequency to page the specifically colored beepers."</li>
          <li>"I do almost all my onling shopping on Amazon because of how easy and simple it is to order items. I have a prime membership and I also don't have to recall all of my payment and shipping information on Amazon."</li>
        </ul><br>

      <section class="requirements">
        <h3 class="casestudy-header">Requirements & Objectives</h3>
        <p>After the client and user interviews, we then defined the requirements of each page on the site as well as objectives.</p><br>

      <section class="companalysis">
        <h3 class="casestudy-header">Competitive Analysis</h3><br>
        <p>Before we began our design, we took a look at some competitors, to see how they structured their website as well as presented their information.</p><br>

        <table class="table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th scope="col">Competitor</th>

            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Competitor 1</th>
              <td>Simple with a bold logo and accents of blue. Site uses rich imagery.</td>
              <td>Messy organization but straightforward tabs and labels.</td>
              <td>Minimal and efficient explanations. Includes videos and images.</td>
              <td>Basic pages and layout. Keeps all information on one scrolling page.</td>
              <td>Uses an easy and clean menu but lacks necessary search navigation.</td>
              <td>A little disorganized but keeps branding consistent and menus easy to navigate.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Competitor 2</th>
              <td>Most information can be found through landing page; bland, woody color palette.</td>
              <td>Works very well; help and FAQ are well implemented, and online store works seamlessly.</td>
              <td>Interesting pages, including “stories”, which are short blog posts about the product</td>
              <td>All information can be found via landing page; most pages headed by jumbotron.</td>
              <td>Navigation is seamless, but different options on desktop and mobile.</td>
              <td>Bland, only employing the use of white/brown. Uses pictures/text placement well.</td>

            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Competitor 3</th>
              <td>Clean and minimal with black/white theme and blue accent.</td>
              <td>Simple contact form, buy now buttons on the middle of the page right when you land on site.</td>
              <td>Contact and social media links conveniently at footer of every page.</td>
              <td>Well organized information on the landing page.</td>
              <td>Simple navigation hiding from the right side.</td>
              <td>Minimal and clean. Great use of space and font choice.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Competitor 4</th>
              <td>Clean and minimalistic design, but lack of branding because it does not focus on logo.</td>
              <td>Informative and responsive for the shopping site.</td>
              <td>Text-heavy and not useful. Lack of illustration to make audiences better understand.</td>
              <td>One page scrolling, a little boring and messy overall.</td>
              <td>Clean and simple, however lack of navigations for some important content.</td>
              <td>Minimalistic, suitable for all ages.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table><br>

        <p>Takeaways</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Best to keep the site clean and intuitive with organized sections of information</li>
          <li>Demonstrate an overall brand in all parts of the site - keep it consistent</li>
          <li>Do not forget to add a search function in both the products and FAQ pages</li>
          <li>Use images with meaning</li>
        </ul><br>

        <p>Good Ideas</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Using diagrams/illustrations to show the functions of the device</li>
          <li>Creating an in depth FAQ’s, customer service page, and about page</li>
          <li>Using a fresh and simple image on the home page</li>
          <li>Getting rid of the red/orange/black brand colors (find a unique branding)</li>
          <li>Less clutter, more to the point</li>
        </ul><br>

        <p>Mood Board</p>

        <h3 class="casestudy-header">Prototyping</h3><br>
        <div class="caption-pic">
          <img class="casestudy-pic" src="img/casestudy/cnd/sitearchitecture.png" alt="clickndig architecture"><br>
          <span class="caption">Site Architecture</span>
        </div>

        <p>We first outlined the site architecture and I created lo-fidelity screen prototypes on Balsamiq using the mobile-first appreach.</p><br>

        <div class="caption-pic">
          <img class="casestudy-pic" src="img/casestudy/cnd/lofiprototype.png" alt="clickndig lofi prototype"><br>
          <span class="caption">Balsamiq prototypes</span>
        </div>

        <p>After going over the architecture and site layout with the client, we came back with some key points to emphasize.</p>
         <ul>
          <li>The home page is the page we needed to put the most focus on</li>
          <li>Need a way to really show functionality and how the product is used</li>
          <li>Provide social proof of the product through the Amazon reviews</li>
        </ul><br>

        <div class="caption-pic">
          <img class="casestudy-pic" src="img/casestudy/cnd/iteration1.png" alt="clickndig iteration 1"><br>
          <span class="caption">Iteration 1 prototype</span>
        </div>

        <p>The feedback we received with this iteration was really to focus on making it easier for the user to buy the product and push for conversion rates. With this in mind, we made the following decisions</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Move the navigation to the left and add a shopping cart button at the top right so the user can access the card from any page</li>
          <li>Add more reviews for the product and include direct link to the product page on Amazon</li>
        </ul><br>

        <h3 class="casestudy-header">Learnings</h3><br>
        <p>Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me. It was my first time working with an actual client with a real product as well as working with the e-commerce industry. Designing in this aspect meant that I had to take into account not only the user's needs, but also the business needs of the client. If given more time with this project, I would have loved to help define measurements of success and continue adjusting the design to further increase the conversion rate.</p>
