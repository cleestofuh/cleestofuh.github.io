      <section class="my-role">
        <h3 class="casestudy-header">My Role</h3><br>
        <p>Inspired by the amount of passion for bubble tea on the Facebook group "subtle asian traits," a group of 3 friends and I wanted to create something together that could be helpful to indecisive people when deciding on a bubble tea shop to go to.</p>
        <p>In the timespan of 1 week, my team of 4 quickly created an app to fufill such purpose. My responsibilities included being the project manager, UI/UX design, and developing the front-end.</p>
        <p class="supporting-text">Tools used: Sketch, InVision, ReactJS</p>
      </section>

      <section class="ideation">
        <h3 class="casestudy-header">Understanding & Defining the Problem</h3><br>
        <p>The problem I wanted to solve came from a post on the "subtle asian traits" group mentioned before. In the post, portrayed a video showing a hand-made spinner wheel to help decide this boba(bubble tea) spot to go to, garnering thousands of likes and responses. People needed a tool to help overcome indecision.</p><br>
        <div class="caption-pic">
          <img class="casestudy-pic" src="img/casestudy/wwgfbt/satpost.png" alt="sat post"><br>
          <span class="caption">screenshot from the subtle asian traits post</span>
        </div>

        <p>First of all, I needed to define the requirements for this project. To do that, I started off with a couple questions, asking people from various friend circles:</p>
        <p>When do you normally go to get bubble tea?</p>
        <p class="supporting-text">There were two common scenarios</p>
        <ul>
          <li>After eating out with a group of friends; considered dessert and extra socializing time</li>
          <li>Going out for the sole purpose of getting bubble tea as a snack or social activity</li>
        </ul><br>

        <p>How do you decide on a spot for bubble tea?</p>
        <p class="supporting-text">"Depending on where we are currently located after the meal, the choice is almost always some place nearby the restaraunt. I search on Yelp and basically filter out from there. This is the point where we sometimes have too many different options and preferences amongst my group of friends and spend an unecessary amount of time deciding on a place."</p><br>

        <p>Based on this, I defined the following goals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Assist indecisiveness within a group to quickly come to a decision</li>
          <li>Find a bubble tea shop based on location</li>
          <li>Can be used easily on mobile due to not being on a computer when out</li>
        </ul><br>
      </section>

      <section class="user-flow">
        <h3 class="casestudy-header">Initial Prototype</h3><br>
        <p>Taking the requirements into consideration, I coordinated a quick ideation session with with the team and started to create an initial prototype using Sketch and InVision.</p><br>

        <div class="caption-pic">
          <img class="casestudy-pic" src="img/casestudy/wwgfbt/prototype1.png" alt="user flow"><br>
          <span class="caption">First prototype</span>
        </div>

        <p>Design Principles</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One primary action per page</li>
          <li>Mobile focused</li>
          <li>Provide ways for user to fix mistakes</li>
        </ul><br>
      </section>

      <section class="testing">
        <h3 class="casestudy-header">Testing</h3><br>
        <p>After the initial design, I tested it with my team along with 2 other users in my bubble-tea-loving friend group.</p>
        <p>I wanted to find out if this tool was intuitive to use as well as if the tool was useful at all.</p><br>

        <p>Questions to answer</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Can the user find bubble tea shops around their area?</li>
          <li>Does it actually assist in the decision making?</li>
        </ul><br>

        <p>Key Findings</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Users want more information up front. It was annoying to have to go to Yelp to see the location and the star ratings.</li>
          <li>Mistakes happen often when clicking the submit button quickly.</li>
          <li>Some of the shops that showed up were never in consideration as an option.</li>
        </ul><br>

      </section>

      <section class="testing">
        <h3 class="casestudy-header">Iteration</h3><br>
        <p>For our second iteration, I redefined our requirements and outlined a new user flow along with adjusting the InVision prototype.</p>
        <p>A working prototype can be found <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/SAPRGBGHZPB#/screens/338511626">here</a></p>

          <span class="caption">Redefined user flow</span>
        </div>

        <p>Additions to the requirements</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bubble tea place is based on location</li>
          <li>Return a random bubble tea shop based on the location</li>
          <li>Able to change the place if vetoed by group</li>
          <li>Know the location and rating of the place</li>
          <li>Filter out options that nobody likes</li>
          <li>See a list of all surrounding bubble tea shops</li>
          <li>See a history of the shops already shown</li>
        </ul><br>

      <section class="Release">
        <h3 class="casestudy-header">Development & Release</h3>
        <p>For the initial release, we wanted to focus on a minimum viable product first and add on more complex features as we go on. My main contribution to this part was getting the front-end ready for data population.</p>
        <p>Since all of the team members were working remotely, I had a Slack workspace set up as well as assigneed tasks through Trello. This helped us keep organized and made sure people were not working on the same thing. At the end of one week, we had all the basic functionality working and are currently slowly releasing the more customizable features.</p><br>

    <section class="Next Steps">
        <h3 class="casestudy-header">Learnings & Next Steps</h3>
        <p>My main motivation for this project was to brush up on my front-end development skills as well as pick up a new technology with React. I also wanted to work on something fun that could be used by my own group of friends.</p>
        <p>For the next steps and improvements, I would like to do more observation about how decisions are made in a group regarding bubble tea shops. I've found that every person has their own preferences on what they like to order which affects which shops they like best. I would like to address the different preferences in future improvements in customization and recommendations.</p><br>
