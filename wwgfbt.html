      <section class="my-role">
        <h3 class="casestudy-header">My Role</h3><br>
        <p>Inspired by the amount of passion for bubble tea on the Facebook group "subtle asian traits," a group of 3 friends and I wanted to create something together that could be helpful to indecicive people when deciding on a bubble tea shop to go to.</p>
        <p>In the timespan of 1 week, my team of 4 quickly created an app to fufill such purpose. My responsibilities included being the project manager, UI/UX design, and developing the front-end.</p>
        <p class="supporting-text">Tools used: Sketch, InVision, ReactJS</p>
      </section>

      <section class="ideation">
        <h3 class="casestudy-header">Understanding & Defining the Problem</h3><br>
        <p>The problem I wanted to solve came from a post on the "subtle asian traits" group mentioned before. In the post, portrayed a video showing a hand-made spinner wheel to help decide this boba(bubble tea) spot to go to. Personally, I related to this problem and set out to build a digital solution.</p><br>
        <div class="caption-pic">
          <img class="casestudy-pic" src="img/casestudy/wwgfbt/satpost.png" alt="sat post"><br>
          <span class="caption">screenshot from the subtle asian traits post</span>
        </div>

        <p>First of all, I needed to define the requirements for this project. To do that, I started off with some questions:</p>
        <p>When do I normally go to get bubble tea?</p>
        <p class="supporting-text">Normally, the option of going to get bubble tea occurs after eating out with a group of friends. This is usally considered a dessert as well as extra time to socialize amongst my friends.</p><br>

        <p>How do I go about finding a spot for bubble tea?</p>
        <p class="supporting-text">Depending on where we are currently locateed after the meal, the choice is almost always some place nearby the restaraunt. I search on Yelp and basicalyl filter out from there. This is the point where we sometimes have too many different options and preferences amongst my group of friends and spend an unecessary amount of time deciding on a place.</p><br>

        <p>Based on this, I defined the following requirements:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bubble tea place is based on location</li>
          <li>Return a random bubble tea shop based on the location</li>


          <li>Able to change the place if vetoed by group</li>
          <li>Know the location and rating of the place</li>
          <li>Filter out options that nobody likes</li>
          <li>See a list of all surrounding bubble tea shops</li>
        </ul><br>
      </section>

      <section class="user-flow">
        <h3 class="casestudy-header">Initial Prototype</h3><br>
        <p>Taking the requirements into consideration, I coordinated a quick ideation session with with the team and started to create an initial prototype using Sketch and InVision.</p><br>

        <div class="caption-pic">
          <img class="casestudy-pic" src="img/casestudy/wwgfbt/prototype1.png" alt="user flow"><br>
          <span class="caption">first prototype</span>
        </div>

        <p>Design Principles</p>
        <ul>
          <li>One primary action per page</li>
          <li>Provide ways for user to fix mistakes</li>
        </ul><br>
      </section>

      <section class="testing">
        <h3 class="casestudy-header">Testing</h3><br>
        <p>After the initial design, I tested it with my team along with 2 other users in my bubble-tea-loving friend group.</p>
        <p>I wanted to find out if this tool was intuitive to use as well as if the tool was useful at all.</p><br>

        <p>Questions to answer</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Can the user find bubble tea shops around their area?</li>
          <li>Is the tool intuitive to use?</li>
          <li>Does it actually assist in the decision making?</li>
        </ul>

      </section>

      <section class="requirements">
        <h3 class="casestudy-header">Requirements & Objectives</h3>

      <section class="companalysis">
        <h3 class="casestudy-header">Competitive Analysis</h3><br>
        <p>Before we began our design, we took a look at some competitors, to see how they structures their website as well as presented their information.</p><br>

        <table class="table">
          <thead>
            <tr>

            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Competitor 1</th>
              <td>Simple with a bold logo and accents of blue. Site uses rich imagery.</td>
              <td>Messy organization but straightforward tabs and labels.</td>
              <td>Minimal and efficient explanations. Includes videos and images.</td>
              <td>Basic pages and layout. Keeps all information on one scrolling page.</td>
              <td>Uses an easy and clean menu but lacks necessary search navigation.</td>
              <td>A little disorganized but keeps branding consistent and menus easy to navigate.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Competitor 2</th>
              <td>Most information can be found through landing page; bland, woody color palette.</td>
              <td>Works very well; help and faq are well implemented, and online store works seamlessly.</td>
              <td>Interesting pages, including “stories”, which are short blog posts about the product</td>
              <td>All information can be found via landing page; Most pages headed by jumbotron.</td>
              <td>Navigation is seamless, but different options on desktop and mobile.</td>

              <td>Simple contact form, Buy now buttons on the middle of the page right when you land on site.</td>
              <td>Contact and social media links conveniently at footer of every page.</td>
              <td>Well organized information on the landing page.</td>
              <td>Simple navigation hiding from the right side.</td>
              <td>Minimal and clean. Great use of space and font choice.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th scope="row">Competitor 4</th>

              <td>Informative and responsive for the shopping site.</td>
              <td>Text-heavy and not useful. Lack of illustration to make audiences better understand.</td>

              <td>Clean and simple, however lack of navigations for some important content.</td>
              <td>Minimalistic, suitable for all ages.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table><br>

        <p>Takeaways</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Best to keep the site clean and intuitive with organized sections of information</li>
          <li>Demonstrate an overall brand in all parts of the site - keep it consistent</li>
          <li>Do not forget to add a search function in both the products and FAQ pages</li>
          <li>Use images with meaning</li>
        </ul><br>

        <p>Good Ideas</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Using diagrams/illustrations to show the functions of the device</li>
          <li>Creating an in depth FAQ’s, customer service page, and about page</li>
          <li>Use a fresh and simple image on the home page</li>
          <li>Get rid of the red/orange/black brand colors (find a unique branding)</li>
          <li>Less clutter, more to the point</li>
        </ul><br>

        <p>Mood Board</p>
        <div class="caption-pic">
          <img class="casestudy-pic" src="img/casestudy/cnd/moodboard.png" alt="clickndig moodboard"><br>
          <span class="caption">Moodboard created from client preferences and competitor inspiration</span>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="lofi-prototype">
        <h3 class="casestudy-header">Prototyping</h3><br>
        <div class="caption-pic">
          <img class="casestudy-pic" src="img/casestudy/cnd/sitearchitecture.png" alt="clickndig architecture"><br>
          <span class="caption">Site Architecture</span>
        </div>

        <p>We first outlined the site architecture and I created lo-fidelity screen prototypes on Balsamiq using the mobile-first appreach.</p><br>

        <div class="caption-pic">
          <img class="casestudy-pic" src="img/casestudy/cnd/lofiprototype.png" alt="clickndig lofi prototype"><br>
          <span class="caption">Balsamiq prototypes</span>
        </div>

        <p>After going over the architecture and site layout with the client, we came back with some key points to iterate on.</p>
         <ul>
          <li>The home page is the page we needed to put the most focus on</li>
          <li>Need a way to really show functionality and how the product is used</li>
          <li>Provide social proof of the product through the amazon reviews</li>
        </ul><br>

        <div class="caption-pic">
          <img class="casestudy-pic" src="img/casestudy/cnd/iteration1.png" alt="clickndig iteration 1"><br>
          <span class="caption">Iteration 1 prototype</span>
        </div>

        <p>The feedback we received with this iteration was really to focus on making it easier for the user to buy the product and push for conversion rates. With this in mind, we made the following deicisions</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Move the navigation to the left and add a shopping cart button at the top right so the user can access the card from any page</li>
          <li>Add more reviews for the product and include direct link to the product page on Amazon</li>
        </ul><br>

        <h3 class="casestudy-header">Learnings</h3><br>
        <p>Overall, this project was a great learning experience for me. It was my first time working with an actual client with a real product as well as working with the ecommerce industry. Designing in this aspect meant that I had to take into account not only the user's needs, but also the business needs of the client. If given more time with this project, I would have loved to help define measurements of success and continue iterating to further increase the conversion rate.</p>
